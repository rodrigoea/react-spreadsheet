# React Spreadsheet

This project was created as part of an application process for a company in the past (mid 2018).

I've decided to share the code for references :)

# Instructions

Here you will see some basic information to run the project.

## Installation

Go into the folder and Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or just `npm`:

```
cd react-spreadsheet && npm install
```

## Running

There's a script to run the project in development mode. In the terminal, run the command:

```
npm run start
```

## Building

There's also a script to build the project. In the terminal, run the command:

```
npm run build
```

A new `build` folder will be created and that's all. You can send this folder to your own server.
